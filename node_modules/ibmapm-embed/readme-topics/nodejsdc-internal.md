## Monitoring Node.js applications in IBM Cloud Private (internal use only)
There are 2 options to use the simplified procedure to deploy Node.js data collector in ICP for internal testing only:
### Option 1:
1. Download the latest data collector build from https://rtpgsa.ibm.com/projects/i/itm_db2_agent/nodejs/cloudnative/NPMCD/latest/, then extract it.
2. Update the Dockerfile for your Node.js application to add the following lines:
    <pre>
    RUN npm install <i>extracted_folder</i>
    COPY <i>path_to_global_file</i> <i>root_of_application</i></pre>
    where, <i>path_to_global_file</i> is the full path to the global.environment file that you downloaded from CEM UI.
    
3. Add the following line to the beginning of the main file of your Node.js application:
<code>require('ibmapm')</code>
4. Build the new Docker image.
5. Update the application yaml file to use the new Docker image.

### Option 2:
1. Update the package.json, add <code> "appmetrics": "^4.0.0" </code> as dependecy.
2. Update the main file of application, add the <code>require('appmetrics')</code> at top.
3. Update the Dockerfile for your Node.js application to add the following lines:
    <pre>
    COPY <i>path_to_global_file</i> <i>root_of_application</i></pre>
    where, <i>path_to_global_file</i> is the full path to the global.environment file that you downloaded from CEM UI.
    
4. Build the new Docker image.
5. Update the application yaml file to use the new Docker image.
