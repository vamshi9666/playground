# Set the environment variables directly

1. In the `package.json` file of your application, add the following line to the `dependencies` section:
    ```
    ibmapm":"^2.0.0"
    ```
2. Add the following line to the beginning of the main file of your Node.js
application:
    ```
    require('ibmapm');
    ```
    
    **Tip**: If you start your application by running the node app.js command, `app.js` is the main file of your application.
3. In the manifest.yml file of your application or the IBM Cloud UI, set the following variables:
    ```
    env:
    IBM_APM_SERVER_INGRESS_URL: 'https://hcdemo.test.perfmgmt.ibm.com/1.0/data/'
    IBM_APM_ACCESS_TOKEN: <Base64_encoded_password>
    ```
    where *`<Base64_encoded_password>`* is the Base64 encoded password with the prefix of plain text authentication type. For example, if the plain text password is 'Basic password', the encrypted password is 'Basic cGFzc3dvcmQ='.

4. From the home directory of your Node.js application, run the following
command:
    ```
    cf push
    ```
